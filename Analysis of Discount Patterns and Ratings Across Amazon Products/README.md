# Amazon Product Discount and Rating Analysis

This project focueses on analyzing a dataset of Amazon products to uncover patterns related to product pricing, discounts, and customer ratings. The dataset includes various attributes such as product names, categories, discounted and actual prices, discount percentages, ratings, and the number of ratings. By exploring these factors, I aim to gain insights into how discounts impact product ratings, identify the most highly rated categories, and explore the relationship between product price and discount strategies. 

## Key Objectives of this analysis include:
* Average Discount Percentage: View the overall average discount percentage across all products in the datases.
* Average Rating by Category: See how different product categories perform based on customer ratings, with bar charts displaying average ratings for each category.
* Product Pricing Insights: Analyze the distribution of discounted and actual prices for products, helping to identify pricing trends and outliers.
* Discount vs Rating Correlation: Explore the relationship between discount percentage and product ratings using a scatter plot.
* Top Discounted Products: Discover the products with the highest discount percentags, displayed in a sortable table.
* Product Rating Distribution: Visualizae the spread of ratings with histograms and learn how often products receive ratings from customers.
* Interactive Filters: Use category, price range, and rating filters to drill down into specific subsets of the data.
